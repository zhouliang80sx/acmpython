# Voronoi Diagram
An app, implementing  Fortune's  sweep line algorithm for building the Voronoi diagram

A Voronoi diagram is a partitioning of a plane into regions based on distance to points in a specific subset of the plane. 
That set of points (called seeds, sites, or generators) is specified beforehand, and for each seed there is 
a corresponding region consisting of all points closer to that seed than to any other. 
These regions are called Voronoi cells.
